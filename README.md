# MIPS


MIPS Instruction Set architecture is a form of assembly language and is a very low-level and compiler-level code. The syntax makes it very easy to observe the dynamics of memory caches in a compiler.

## Compiling

Use the online compiler https://rivoire.cs.sonoma.edu/cs351/wemips/ to access an easy-to-use MIPS Compiler. Delete the existing code and paste the code from the file and paste it into the compiler. On the right side of the page, click the 'c' button to see activity on the caches.


## Usage

```MIPS
.data
#put your variables here

.text
#put your code here
```
